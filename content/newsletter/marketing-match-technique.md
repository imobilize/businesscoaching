# The Marketing Match Technique
This particular technique allows you to find “Hot Pockets” of customers eagerly looking for what you sell. Well, to be honest, it’s really the reverse. The technique ensures they find you with minimal effort on your part.

I once came across a master salesman, one of the most successful in America, that claimed that selling is simple, unless you make it complicated. He then went on to show his greatest secret for keeping it simple.   

**So what’s the big secret?**

Well, the wise old salesman said **“you’ll corral lots more customers by intercepting them wherever they are looking for someone like you”.**

## How do we apply this as a technique?
First, to fully understand the technique let’s analyse the problem.   
Look, most marketing that brands put out is simply noise. It’s a way to grab attention! The hope is that prospects will notice them among the huge crowd and decide that somehow they are best suited to fulfil whatever need that prospect has.

It reminds me of going to a crowded market. You know the ones that sell random items on market stalls? Imagine every vendor behind their stall shouting at the top of their lungs at you. Now imagine that all the market stalls were selling identical products and they were all shouting exactly the same words to grab your attention.

#### Do you think this would be a good way to sell anything to anyone?   
No, of course not. Yet, this is how most people go about doing business online. This is exactly how small businesses start trying to sell their products on the internet.   
The outcome? Their business struggles to make any money and ultimately they fail and pack it all up.   

#### Let’s see an example:

Let’s say that you sell pet accessories. Now, you could create a website, and a series of Google and banner ads, trumpeting your product line, “Pet Accessories.”   

Seems like it would work right? It’s what most companies do.   
**The problem is**, people don’t go online searching for “a generic product line.” Almost nobody searches for “Pet Accessories.” That’s way too broad.   
Even if they did, how could you outrank anyone else in Google selling “Pet Accessories”?    

Go ahead, search for the google term “Pet Accessories” and see what comes up. Look how many brands there are. Which do you choose?

All of these brands are just like vendors in the market stalls shouting at the top of their lungs. <u>They are like everyone else in a crowded space.</u> The way they market is to add to the noise.

## How do you apply the Marketing Match Technique?   
This technique solves the core problem of your brand not standing out from the crowd. Once you apply the technique you no longer have to worry about fighting competitors for the same customers. Applying the technique on the internet means matching your selling process, your marketing messages, your branding to the way people search online. 

### What does that mean exactly?
People go online searching for a single product.

For example, they go online searching for “Dog Raincoat”. It’s a type of Pet Accessory but it’s a very specific item that someone is clearly looking to purchase at some point.

Now imagine you had a brand name, website name or a specific page on your website with the url and title “Dog Raincoat”. A few awesome things happen as a consequence.
* Google would rank your web page highly for that specific term because it’s an exact match to what people are searching for
* People would have greater trust in your brand because you clearly fulfil their need based on marketing match
* You have extra credibility as a trusted source because google is now showing you at the top and saying we have found what you need
* There would be less competition because everyone else has been trying to get noticed for “Pet Accessories” rather than something very specific

#### And what’s the result of applying this simple marketing match technique?   
Your sales multiplied of course. Because you have intercepted your customers exactly where they are looking for someone like you.

Become a perfect match for your customer. Make them fall in love with you and they will pay you handsomely as a consequence.
