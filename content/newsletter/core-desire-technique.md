# The Core Desire Technique

The Core Desire technique attracts your perfect customer by using something that they desire the most.

## How does it work?
When you go to the store to buy a drill what are you really after? Think about it for a second. Are you spending your hard earned money because you had a strong desire for a bit of hardware with a motor that turns a piece of metal at a rapid speed?

Of course not.   
Your core desire for buying a drill is because you want a “hole in the wall”

Look, most people buy any item for an underlying purpose aka a **Core Desire.** 

Here are some examples:   
* A Ferrari - to be seen as hot stuff among your friends and family
* A mop - to have a clean floor
* A camera - to have lasting memories of your happiest moments

Do you get the point? <u>All purchases</u> have an underlying Core Desire that we aim to satisfy.

## How can this powerful technique be used for branding?   
You’ll find that when you name your brand after a Core Desire, you will appeal to your target audience much better than if you used a name that is vanilla and generic. Using a Core Desire in your overcrowded marketplace sets you apart from armies of me-too competitors who try to be everything to everybody, and wind up meaning nothing special to anyone.

### Here’s some examples.

Ever heard of BeachBody Fitness?   
They are one of the biggest, most well known fitness brands on the planet. Take note of how many fitness companies exist. Most fitness companies are fighting over the scraps in the market. Whereas Beach Body get the highest paying clients with little to no effort.

Ask yourself:   
When you sign up to a gym or fitness program what are you really after? You don’t want the uncomfortable feeling that comes from working out do you? Even the word fitness has a feeling of sweat, pain and hard work associated with it. Isn’t your core desire <u>to have a Beach Body</u> instead?

When I learnt this technique, I re-branded my digital agency to Outsourced Sales. You can see the website here: <https://outsourcedsales.com>

**Why?**   
Because people aren’t doing marketing for the love of attracting attention. Their core desire for running a business is making sales. And most of the companies I know don’t even want to touch this stuff. They would rather outsource it to someone who knows what they are doing.

Using the **Core Desire Technique** is the surest way I know to attract and bond with your kindred spirits, your true believers, your most loyal customers, your best clients and even your friends.

Please use this technique for good. I dread to think that I gave someone this powerful secret and they used it to scam or cause harm.
