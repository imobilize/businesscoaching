# The Reason Why Technique
There is a secret trigger word that makes more of your prospects say yes than any other word in the English language. This technique is based on that word. The impact on boosting the response from your potential customers is so potent, it's magical. But even though this technique can seem like magic, as with all the techniques I give you, it is very much grounded in science.    

So let's first start with why the technique works.


## Why does the technique work?  
A famous scientist conducted a compliance experiment in the 1970s. He wanted to see how words could impact human behaviour. Even he was surprised at the outcome!

Ellen Langer (Professor of Psychology at Harvard) had people request to break in on a line of people waiting to use a busy copy machine on a college campus.
<i>People did a lot more copying back then, so there were often lines waiting to use a copy machine.</i>

Now, think of how frustrated you get when someone jumps the queue ahead of you. Would you let them get away with it?

Well, as part of the experiment Langer had people use three different, carefully worded requests to jump the queue and break in line:

* “Excuse me, I have 5  pages.  May I use the xerox machine?”
* “Excuse me, I have 5  pages.  May I use the xerox machine, because I have to make copies?”
* “Excuse me, I have 5  pages.  May I use the xerox machine, because I’m in a rush?”

Did the wording affect whether people let them break in line? 

#### Here are the results:

* “Excuse me, I have 5  pages.  May I use the xerox machine?” [60% compliance]
* “Excuse me, I have 5  pages.  May I use the xerox machine, because I have to make copies?”[93% compliance]
* “Excuse me, I have 5  pages.  May I use the xerox machine, because I’m in a rush?” [94% compliance]

#### Astonishing:
Using the word “because” and giving a reason resulted in significantly more compliance.

This was true even when the reason was not very compelling. “because I have to make copies” was simply repeating an already known fact.

Langer concluded that people go on “automatic” behaviour or “mindlessness” as a short-cut. And hearing the word “because” followed by a reason (no matter how lame the reason is), causes us to comply.

In summary, people automatically behave how you want them to when you give them **A Reason Why**

## So what does this mean for our brand?
Think of how many well known brands give you a reason why to buy from them. Sometimes this reason can be their Unique Selling Point (USP). Often, it’s embedded in a slogan or tagline of the brand.

#### Here are some examples:

Coca Cola has had a few different slogans over the years. What they are saying with each slogan is that you should drink Coca Cola because:
* Delicious and Refreshing
* Life Tastes Good
* Can’t Beat the Real Thing
* Together Tastes Better

These may not seem like very good reasons why but remember the experiment. Compliance went from 60 to 93% even with a lame reason.

And what about Gillette the razor blade for men? Their slogan was used for over 30 years:
* The Best A Man Can Get

So if you want your brand to get an army of people buying, choose a USP and give them a reason why. Create a slogan that gets them to comply.
