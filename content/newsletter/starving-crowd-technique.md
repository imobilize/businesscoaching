# The Starving Crowd Technique   
After you have seen this technique you will understand why it belongs to a marketing genius. Let's see if you agree that this genius, who I will reveal in a moment, deserves the title of the one of the greatest marketers that ever lived.

## How does this technique work?   
To explain the technique, the lesson starts with a challenge:   
"If you and I both owned a hamburger stand and we were in a contest to see who could sell the most hamburgers, what advantages would you most like to have on your side to help you win?"

The answers to this question will vary. You might say:   
* you would like to have the advantage of having superior meat from which to make their burgers
* Or perhaps you want nice tasting sesame seed buns
* Others might say they want a location with my people passing by
* Someone usually wants to be able to offer the lowest prices

And so on.

I would say "O.K., I'll give you every single advantage you have asked for. I, myself, only want one advantage and, if you will give it to me, I will (when it comes to selling burgers) whip the pants off all of you!”

Then you might ask, well what advantage do you want?   
"The only advantage I want," I would reply...   
"Is…”

**“A Starving Crowd!"**

Think about it. When it comes to marketing in general, the most reliable source of huge profits is to be able to tell a group of people (i.e a market) that you have exactly what they need to relieve their pain at that moment in time.

Imagine a crowd being in a desert with nothing to drink. Their thirst would be overwhelming. Now imagine you showed up with bottles of water and asked them to pay a price. How many people would try to get it cheaper?
No one. You could charge whatever it is they could afford. You could easily name your price.

## So how does this apply to branding?   
The way you apply this to branding is very similar in nature to the Core Desire Technique I mentioned in a previous bullet. You know it’s a starving crowd when lots of people are searching for that particular item, solution, thing to purchase online. Some people might search for a different phrase wanting the same solution. But there are ways to find what people are <u>searching for the most</u>.

Once you know what people are searching the majority of time, you name your brand, website, social handles after that search term. You have now instantly identified yourself as the go to solution for their problem.   

No one even questions it. You must be their solution right?   
**Google doesn’t lie.**   
They searched for it and Google produced an instant match to what they were looking for. You have now just appealed to your starving crowd.

#### If you are thinking "how do I go about finding this starving crowd"?    
In my Branding For Profit course, I explain exactly how to do it. I show what tools you can use and many more tricks you can apply to create a phenomenal brand.

### Oh, and the person to give credit to for this marketing lesson?   
It's a famous copywriter called Gary Halbert. This is just one of the gems he taught me through reading his content. Believe me, there are many more. Although he didn't teach me the actual technique to apply it to branding, I still give credit for the lesson because that allowed me to create the technique. And in turn, generate nice tidy profits.
