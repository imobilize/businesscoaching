## Introduction

This coaching agreement is entered into between Barrett Business Partners providing coaching services (The Coach) and the client.
It will begin on the date that the client purchases any coaching program or coaching services from The Coach such as Business Launch Academy. The agreement will continue until such time as the program ends or the client terminates the coaching services.

## Delivery

The client will be given a schedule of coaching hours based on the program purchased. The schedule will vary depending on the program and the time of year the program commences. For most programs such as the Business Launch Academy, the usual sessions will be weekly business coaching via Zoom unless otherwise specified by The Coach. The coaching session will either be a group or individual call at the agreed upon time. The purpose of the coaching sessions is to provide the client with more confidence in their business choices and for the client to learn how to implement business growth strategies.

It is up to the client to attend promptly at the allocated time of the coaching session. If the client does not attend within the first 5 mins of the scheduled time, their appointment will be cancelled with no recourse for the client to obtain a refund of any money or have the session rescheduled.  

There will be a best effort from The Coach to rearrange a coaching session based on a clients request if given more than 2 weeks notice. There is, however, no guarantee from The Coach that this request will be fulfilled. The Coach will provide an alternative coaching session if for whatever reason they are not able to attend.

## Coaching Success Guidelines

For any coaching program to be successful, there is a need for the client to be proactive and participate to 100% of their abilities. If the coaching services and/or program are being delivered as described, then success comes from the client actively:

* carrying out coaching tasks
* attending coaching sessions regularly
* watching the video courses
* reading the suggested material
* taking coaching advice

There is an agreed understanding, that for the success of any coaching program or coaching services, these guidelines need to be followed. The client agrees to follow these guidelines.

### Fees

The fee for the coaching sessions will be included as part of the cost of the program. Separate coaching sessions outside of the program can be arranged for an additional fee. This particular fee will be charged in advance of that session at an amount determined by The Coach and agreed by the client. The fee is payable either by bank transfer or through a payment provider.

### Cancellation Policy

Fees paid for any coaching program are non-refundable except in the event that there is a refund guarantee to the contrary. Clients do not have the right to cancel payment in advance of the billing date for outstanding fees owed for a coaching program purchased. In the event that a client is no longer able to participate in the program once the program has started, an alternative arrangement can be discussed with The Coach. The alternatives can include, but are not limited to, participating in another program.

### Termination

Termination of this agreement may occur at the discretion of The Coach. As long as the client adheres to the Coaching Success Guidelines and The Coach adheres to professional practices and standards, the relationship will continue.
Examples of reasons for termination of the agreement:

* Lack of payment
* Lack of adherence to Coaching Success Guidelines
* Inaction on the part of the client to tasking activities

### Refund Guarantee

A refund guarantee is given for The Business Launch Academy program. The goal of that program is to help the client achieve their first sales or an uplift in sales equivalent to the cost of the program. The expected timescale for this to happen is within 6 months of commencing the program. The Coach will provide business strategies as well as the necessary confidence to the client to implement these strategies. Under normal circumstances, the combination of these services provided along with the client being proactive with the implementation will allow for the timescale of the uplift in sales to be met. However, if the client does not adhere to The Coaching Success Guidelines, it is unreasonable for The Coach to provide a refund guarantee. The client will need to fulfil their side of the coaching agreement. For the guarantee to be upheld, the client has to:

* not miss any payments owed
* have fully adhered to the Coaching Success Guidelines
* has taken part in all the coaching tasks and activities  
* has raised an issue with their progress well in advance so that The Coach can put in place corrective actions
* any corrective actions have been followed by the client

A 100% refund will be given (or an alternative similar value replacement) if the client has fulfilled their part of the coaching agreement.

### Disclaimer

The methods employed by The Coach do not guarantee results. They are guidelines that the client must follow through on in order to see any type of benefit. The client agrees, therefore, to hold The Coach free of any liability and responsibility for adverse reactions, personal or business loss as a result of participation in any coaching program or service.

## Confidentiality

The Coach and the client agree to never share the following information with others, unless mutually agreed upon ahead of time:
